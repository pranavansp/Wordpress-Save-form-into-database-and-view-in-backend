Wordpress, Save form data into database and retrieve in backend

Here i have include codes which used to save forms data into database and retrieve it in admin dashboard.

For Front end Customer form -> \wp-content\themes\illdy\customForm.php as a template name under "Request Page". Create a page "Customer Request" using that template.

For Backend, i have defined function - > function my_admin_menu() for call label in dashboard and and that button call another function -> myplguin_admin_page() to view records as table inside that admin dashbaord.

Thank you!
